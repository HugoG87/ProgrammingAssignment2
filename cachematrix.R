## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

## Write a short comment describing this function
## The first function, makeVector creates a special "matrixr", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the vector
## get the value of the vector
## set the value of the mean
## get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL 
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## The next function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
